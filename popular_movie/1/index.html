		26-year-old Arjun Talwar is an extraordinary cricketer from Chandigarh with the highest batting average in all of India and 106 half-centuries, fifty-two centuries, nine double centuries and two triple centuries to his name. Following the 1985-86 Duleep Trophy finals, Arjun awaits news of his selection in the India national team, only to find out his inclusion in the list was a misprint. Following this, he quits cricket. Arjun then applies for a job in the food sector and shortly after marries his girlfriend Vidya, with whom he has a son named Ketan, nicknamed Kittu. However, sometime in the early 1990s, Arjun is suspended from his job on corruption charges, although he is innocent.
