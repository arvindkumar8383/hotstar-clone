		The story now goes into flashback mode, where Bobby is a leftist student union leader at a college in Kakinada that deals with severe anger management issues. He's a rebel without a cause, like his grandfather Comrade Suryam. He fights with a local politician, Bulliah's brother, due to whom a girl from his college attempts suicide on repeated torture from him to reciprocate his love. He even spends a night in the lock-up with his friends over this. While returning, he runs into Lilly, aka Aparna Devi, who causes him a minor accident, and as compensation, Bobby takes away all her money to fix his bike. He returns home and gets to know that Lilly was, in fact, his childhood friend, (cousin of his neighbour's daughter Jaya) who has come to attend Jaya's wedding. Lilly keeps heartily teasing Bobby over his earlier infatuation with Jaya. During a local cricket match, Bobby discovers that Lilly is, in fact, a state-level cricket player.
