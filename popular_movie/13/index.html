		The film begins with Gautham in a prison saying that he too has a story to tell. The film cuts to Yamini and Gautham's story. They are in a live-in relationship. Gautham is pursuing his dream of becoming a writer. Yamini takes care of Gautham like a mother and is always supportive of his decisions. But she doesn't see him putting in any effort for his dream and is fed up with her routine life. She eventually breaks up with Gautham.

This makes Gauthum start writing again and he writes a story that takes place in Yellandu. The protagonist Srinu is a union leader in the coal mines and is married to Suvarna unwillingly and the couple has a 5-year old son. The newly appointed officer, Ms. Smitha gets close to Srinu, unaware that he is married. Srinu does not disclose his marital status either and starts to avoid his own wife Suvarna. Suvarna suspects that her husband is having an extra-marital affair but doesn't confront him. Instead, she decides to pursue her career. She tops her examinations and it is published in the local newspaper, causing Smitha realise that Srinu is married, that too with a son. Srinu upon rushing home finds Suvarna in a modern dress. She tells him that she'll be whatever he wants her to be, including wearing revealing clothes and make-up. All this made Srinu understand his mistake and go back to loving his wife. The story ends with a note from Gautham saying that Srinu sacrificed everything to be with his wife.
