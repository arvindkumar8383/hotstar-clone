		Aditya "Adi" Gunjal (Aditya Roy Kapur) comes to Mumbai to work for a gaming company owned by his boss (Prahlad Kakkar), aspiring to make it big in the United States as a video game developer. At Mumbai railway station, he spots a girl (Shraddha Kapoor) on the adjacent platform trying to jump in front of an approaching train. A horrified Adi gives her a shout. The girl then disappears.

Adi moves into Gopi Srivastava's house (Naseeruddin Shah), his elder brother's senior, a strict, retired High Court judge living with his wife Charu (Leela Samson). Charu is a renowned Hindustani classical singer who suffers from stage two Alzheimer's disease. On his first day at work, Adi is encouraged by his friend Bantee to pitch the idea of his game "Mumbai 2.0" to his boss. Adi impresses his boss and gets a deadline of five months to prepare a prototype for Los Angeles for a competition.
